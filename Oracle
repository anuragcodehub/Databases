Certainly! Below are sample database scripts for creating tables, views, functions, stored procedures, triggers, and insert scripts in an Oracle database. You can modify these scripts as needed for your specific requirements:

### Table Creation Script:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    last_name VARCHAR2(50),
    hire_date DATE,
    salary NUMBER
);
```

### View Creation Script:
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

### Function Creation Script:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_bonus(salary NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
    bonus NUMBER;
BEGIN
    bonus := salary * 0.1;
    RETURN bonus;
END;
```

### Stored Procedure Creation Script:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_salary(employee_id NUMBER, new_salary NUMBER) IS
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees
    SET salary = new_salary
    WHERE employee_id = employee_id;
    COMMIT;
END;
```

### Trigger Creation Script:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER before_employee_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    :NEW.hire_date := SYSDATE;
END;
```

### Insert Script:
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date, salary)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', TO_DATE('2024-03-28', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 60000);
```

You can run these scripts in your Oracle database environment to create the necessary database objects and populate data. Feel free to customize them further to suit your specific needs.
